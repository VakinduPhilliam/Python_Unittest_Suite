# Python Unittest
# unittest.mock � mock object library
# unittest.mock is a library for testing in Python.
# It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.
# unittest.mock provides a core Mock class removing the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite.
# After performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with.
# You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.
# 
# Additionally, mock provides a patch() decorator that handles patching module and class level attributes within the scope of a test, along with sentinel
# for creating unique objects.
# 
# Mock is very easy to use and is designed for use with unittest. Mock is based on the �action -> assertion� pattern instead of �record -> replay� used by
# many mocking frameworks.

# If any members of the iterable are exceptions they will be raised instead of returned:
# 

iterable = (33, ValueError, 66)

m = MagicMock(side_effect=iterable)
m()

# OUTPUT: '33'

m()

m()

# OUTPUT: '66'
