# Python Unittest
# unittest.mock — mock object library
# unittest.mock is a library for testing in Python.
# It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.
# unittest.mock provides a core Mock class removing the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite.
# After performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with.
# You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.
# 
# Additionally, mock provides a patch() decorator that handles patching module and class level attributes within the scope of a test, along with sentinel
# for creating unique objects.
# 
# Mock is very easy to use and is designed for use with unittest. Mock is based on the ‘action -> assertion’ pattern instead of ‘record -> replay’ used by
# many mocking frameworks.
#

#
# patch builtins
#
 
#
# You can patch any builtins within a module.
#

#
# The following example patches builtin ord():
# 

@patch('__main__.ord')

def test(mock_ord):
        mock_ord.return_value = 101

        print(ord('c'))

test()

# OUTPUT: '101'
