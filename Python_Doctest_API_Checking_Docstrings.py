# Python Doctest API
# The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work
# exactly as shown.
#
#  There are several common ways to use doctest:
# > To check that a module’s docstrings are up-to-date by verifying that all interactive examples still work as documented.
# > To perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples from a test file or a test object work as expected.
# > To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated with input-output examples.
#   Depending on whether the examples or the expository text are emphasized, this has the flavor of “literate testing” or “executable documentation”.
#

# Checking Examples in Docstrings
# 
# The simplest way to start using doctest (but not necessarily the way you’ll continue to do it) is to end each module M with:
# 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest

    doctest.testmod()
